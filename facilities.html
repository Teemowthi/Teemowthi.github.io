            <div class="ccs-textdesc">"The Uytengsu computer facilities at Silliman University have become a cornerstone of digital learning, research, and student entrepreneurship on campus. Built and supported through the philanthropy of the Uytengsu Foundation and its benefactors, these facilities bring together modern computer labs, incubator-style learning spaces, and collaborative research areas designed to prepare students for real-world technology challenges.
    The College of Computer Studies occupies the Uytengsu Foundation Computer Center and the larger Uytengsu Foundation Computer Studies Hall — purpose-built structures that provide classrooms, labs, and faculty offices for Silliman’s computing programs. These buildings were donated by the Uytengsu Foundation and have housed the College since their inauguration, enabling the university to centralize computing education in facilities optimized for instruction and hands-on practice.

            <div class="ccs-textdesc">At the heart of the complex are multiple computer laboratories configured for different instructional needs: general-purpose teaching labs for programming and systems classes, specialized labs for networking and systems administration, and higher-capacity rooms for classes that require individual machines. These labs are fitted with up-to-date workstations and software that support the curricula of Computer Science, Information Technology, and Information Systems programs — allowing students to practice coding, run simulations, develop databases, and test applications in supervised classroom settings.
                   One notable, signature space is the Apps Incubation and Development Laboratory (often referred to as the “Apps Lab”) housed within the Uytengsu facilities. The Apps Lab is designed as an incubator-style environment where students transform creative ideas into functioning mobile and web applications. It encourages iteration, rapid prototyping, and collaborative problem-solving — giving student teams access to mentoring, development toolchains, and a culture that treats mistakes as essential steps toward innovation. This space is intended not only for coursework but also for capstone projects and community-oriented technology solutions

            <div class="ccs-textdesc">"Silliman’s recent investments have pushed the Uytengsu complex toward a more interdisciplinary model. The Uytengsu Transformative Learning Center (announced and inaugurated in early 2025) expands that vision with integrative mini-laboratories — compact, flexible rooms that can be reconfigured for short research sprints, small team projects, or cross-discipline workshops. These mini-labs are intended to support instruction, research, and community engagement in a way that encourages collaboration between computing students and other academic disciplines.
